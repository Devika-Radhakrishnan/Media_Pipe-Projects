Here are some projects that uses media pipe concepts to detect various poses
Face detection:
Real-time Face Detection with Mediapipe and OpenCV
This project showcases real-time face detection using the Mediapipe library and OpenCV in Python. It employs the Face Detection module of Mediapipe to identify and draw bounding boxes around faces captured through the webcam.

Features:
Face Detection: Utilizes the Mediapipe library's Face Detection module to detect and locate faces in real-time from webcam video input.
Visual Feedback: Draws bounding boxes around detected faces on the video stream for visual feedback.
User-friendly Interface: Provides a simple interface for users to experience real-time face detection on their webcam feed.
Easy Integration: Requires minimal setup and dependencies, making it easy for developers to integrate face detection into their projects.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
Mediapipe
OpenCV
How to Use:
Install the required dependencies: pip install mediapipe opencv-python
Clone the repository: git clone (https://github.com/Devika-Radhakrishnan/Media_Pipe-Projects)
Navigate to the project directory: cd real-time-face-detection
Run the main script: python face_detection.py
Observe the webcam feed with real-time face detection and bounding box overlays.
Future Improvements:
Implement facial recognition for identifying specific individuals.
Integrate additional features, such as emotion recognition or head pose estimation.
Optimize the code for performance on various devices.
